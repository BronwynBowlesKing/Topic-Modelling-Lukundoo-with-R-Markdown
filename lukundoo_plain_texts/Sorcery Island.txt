                            SORCERY ISLAND      WHEN I regained consciousness I was on my feet, standing erect, near  enough to my burning aeroplane to feel the warmth radiated by the  crackling flames with which every part of it was ablaze; far enough  from it to be, despite the strong breeze, much more aware of the fierce  heat of the late forenoon sunrays beating down on me from almost  overhead out of the cloudless sky. My shadow, much shorter than I, was  sharply outlined before me on the intensely white sand of the beach;  which dazzling expanse, but a few paces to my right, ended abruptly  in an almost straight line, at a little bank of about eight inches  of exposed blackish loam, beyond which was dense tropical vegetation  gleaming in the brilliant sunshine. Not much farther away on my left  were great patches, almost heaps, fathoms long, yards wide and one or  even two or three feet high, of unwholesome looking grayish white slimy  foam, like persistent dirty soap-bubbles, strung along the margin of  the sparkling dry sand, between it and the swishes of hissing froth  that lashed lazily up from the sluggish breakers in which ended the  long, broad-backed, sleepy swells of the endlessly recurrent ocean  surges. As there was no cloud in the dark blue firmament, so there  was no sail, no funnel-smoke in sight on the deep blue sea. Overhead,  against the intense blue sky, whirled uncountable flocks of garishly  pink flamingoes, some higher, some lower, crossing and recrossing each  other, grotesque, flashing, and amazing in their myriads.    To my scrutinizing gaze, as to my first glance, it was manifest that  there was no indication of wreckage, breakage or injury to any part of  my aeroplane visible through the flames now fast consuming it. No bone  of me was broken, no ligament strained. I had not a bruise on me, not a  scratch. I did not feel shaken or jarred, my garments were untorn and  not even rumpled or mussed. I conjectured at once, what is my settled  opinion after long reflection, that I, in my stupor or trance or daze  or whatever it was, had made some sort of a landing, had unstrapped  myself, had clambered out of the fuselage, had staggered away from it,  and had fainted; and that, while I was unconscious, some one had set  fire to my aeroplane.    As I stood there on the beach I was flogging my memory to make it  bridge over my interval of unconsciousness and I recollected vividly  what had preceded my lapse and every detail of my sensations. I had  been flying my aeroplane between the wide blue sky, unvaried by any  cloud, and the wide blue sea, unbroken by any sign of sail, steamer or  island. Then I descried a difference of appearance at one point of the  horizon forward and on my right and steered towards it. Soon I made  sure of a low island ahead of me.    Up to that instant I had never, in all my life, had anything resembling  a delusion or even any thoughts that could be called queer. But, just  as I made certain that I was approaching an island, there popped into  my head, for no assignable reason, the recollection of the flock of  white geese on my grandmother’s farm and of how I, when seven years old  or so, or maybe only six or perhaps even younger, used to make a pet  of an unusually large and most uncommonly docile and friendly white  gander, used to fondle him, and, in particular, used to straddle him  and fairly ride about on him, he flapping his wings and squawking.    While I was wondering what in the world had made me think of that  gander, all of a sudden, as I neared the island and would soon be over  it, I had an indubitable delusion. Instead of seeing before me and  about me the familiar parts of my aeroplane, I seemed to see nothing  but sky and sea and myself astraddle of an enormous white gander,  longer than a canoe, and bigger than a dray-horse; I seemed to see  his immense, dazzlingly white wings, ten yards or more in spread,  rhythmically beating the air on either side of me; I seemed to see,  straight out in front of me, his long white neck, the flattened,  rounded top of his big head, and the tip of his great yellow bill  against the sky; what was more, instead of seeing my knees clad in  khaki, my calves swathed in puttees and my feet in brown boots, I  seemed to see my knees in blue corduroy knickerbockers, my legs in blue  ribbed woolen stockings, against the white feathers of that gigantic  dream-gander’s back, and my feet sticking out on either side of him  encased in low, square-toed shoes of black leather, of the cut one sees  in pictures of Continental soldiers or of Benjamin Franklin as a lad,  their big silver buckles plain to me against the blueness of the ocean  far below me.    After being swallowed up in this astounding hallucination, which I  vividly recalled, I remembered nothing until I came to myself, standing  on the beach by what was left of my blazing aeroplane.    While struggling to recollect what I could remember and trying to  surmise what had happened during my unconsciousness, I had been  surveying my surroundings. On one hand I saw only the limitless and  unvaried ocean from which came the cool sea-breeze that fanned my  left cheek and stirred my hair under the visor of my cap; on the  other opened a wide, flat-floored valley, bounded by low hills,  the highest, at the head of the valley, not over ninety feet above  sea-level, crowned by a huge palatial building of pinkish stone, its  two lofty stories topped by an ornate carved balustrade above which  no roof showed, so that I inferred that the roof was flat. The hills  shutting in my view on either side, lower and lower towards the  sea, were rounded and covered with a dense growth of scrubby trees,  not quite tall enough to be called forest. Close to the beach and  hills, on each side of the valley, was what looked like a sort of  model garden village. That on my right, as I faced inland, was of  closely-set one-story cottages, bowered in flowering vines, under  a grove of handsome, exotic-looking trees. The other, which I saw  beyond the slackening flames above the embers of my aeroplane, was of  roomy, broad-verandahed, two-story villas, generously spaced, beneath  magnificent young shade-trees, mostly loaded with brilliant flowers.    As I was looking at the valley, the villages, the palace on the  hill-top and from one to the other, with now and then a glance  overhead at the hosts of wheeling flamingoes, I thought I had a second  hallucination. I seemed to see, along a path through the riotous  greenery, a human figure approaching me, but, when it drew near and I  seemed to see it more clearly, I felt that it must be a figment of my  imagination.    It was that of a tall, perfectly formed and gracefully moving young  man. But, under the scorching rays of that caustic sunshine he was  bareheaded and his shock of abundant, wavy and brilliantly yellow  golden hair was bobbed off short below his ears like the hair of  Italian page-boys in early Florentine and Venetian paintings. His  eyes were very bright and a very light blue, his cheeks rosy, his  bare neck pinkish. He was clad only in a tight-fitting stockinet  garment of green silk, something like the patent underwear shown in  advertising pictures. It looked very new, very silky and very green,  and as unsuitable as possible for the climate, for its long, clinging  sleeves reached to his wrists and the tight legs of it sheathed him  to his ankles. His feet were encased in high laced shoes of a very  bright, and apparently very soft, yellow leather, with (I was sure he  was an hallucination) _every one of the five toes of each formed  separately_.    Just as I was about to rub my eyes to banish this disconcerting  apparition, I recognized him and saw him recognize me.    It was Pembroke!    His face, as he recognized me, did not express pleasure; what mine  expressed, besides amazement, I could not conjecture. All in a  flash my mind ran over what I knew of him and had heard. We had  first met as freshmen and had seen little of each other during  our life as classmates. Pembroke, at college, had been noted as  the handsomest student of his day; as the youngest student of his  class; as surrounding himself with the most luxurious furnishings,  the most beautiful and costly pictures, bronzes, porcelains and art  objects ever known in the quarters of any student at our college;  as very self-indulgent, yet so brilliantly gifted that he stood  fifth or sixth in a large class with an unusual proportion of bright  students; as daft about languages, music and birds, and, frequently  descanting on the wickedness and folly of allowing wild bird-life to  be all-but exterminated; as so capricious and erratic that most of his  acquaintances thought him odd and his enemies said he was cracked.    I had not seen him since our class dispersed after its graduation and  the attendant ceremonies and festivities. I had heard that, besides  having a very rich father, he had inherited, on his twenty-first  birthday, an income of over four hundred thousand dollars a year and a  huge accumulation of ready cash; that he had at once interested himself  in the creation of refuges for migratory, rare and picturesque birds;  that his fantastic whimsicalities and eccentricities had intensified so  as to cause a series of quarrels and a complete estrangement between  himself and his father; that he had bought an island somewhere and  had absorbed himself in the fostering of wild bird-life and in the  companionship of very questionable associates.    He held out his hand and we shook hands.    “You don’t seem injured or hurt at all, Denbigh,” he said. “How did you  manage to get out of that blazing thing alive, let alone without any  sign of scratch or scorch?”    “I must have gotten out of it before it caught fire,” I replied. “I  must have gone daffy or lost my wits as I drew over your island. I have  no idea how I landed or why. The whole thing is a blank to me.”    “You are lucky,” he said, matter-of-factly, “to have landed at all.  If your mind wandered, it is a miracle you did not smash on the coral  rocks on the other side of the island or on one of the outlying keys,  or fall into the ocean and drown.    “However, all’s well that ends well. Nothing can be salvaged from the  wreckage of your conveyance, that is clear. What you need is a bracer,  food, rest, a bath, sleep, fresh clothes and whatever else will soothe  you. Come along. I’ll do all I can for you.”    I followed him past the remnants of my aeroplane, along the beach, to  the group of villas. Close to them and to the beach was a sort of park  or open garden, with fountains playing and carved marble seats set here  and there along concrete walks between beds of flowers, shrubberies,  and trim lawns, all canopied by astonishingly vigorous and well-grown  ornamental trees.    As we approached the nearest villa I saw a family group on its veranda,  obviously parents and children; also I heard some one whistling  “Annie Laurie” so exquisitely as to evidence superlative artistry.  As we passed the entrance to the villa I was amazed to recognize  Radnor, another classmate. But, as he ran down the steps to greet me,  I reflected that there was nothing really astonishing in a man as  opulent as Pembroke having as dependable a physician as he could engage  resident on his island nor anything unnatural in his choosing an  acquaintance.    “Denbigh,” said Pembroke, “has dropped on us out of the wide blue sky.  His aeroplane has been demolished, so he’ll sojourn with us a while.”    “You don’t seem to need me,” Radnor commented, conning me. “I see no  blood and no indications of any broken bones. Can I patch you up,  anywhere?”    “Not a bruise on me, as far as I know,” I replied.    “Then,” he laughed, “my prescription is two hours abed. Get undressed  and horizontal and stay so till you really feel like getting up. And  not more than one nip of Pembroke’s guest-brandy, either. Get flat with  no unnecessary delay and sleep if you can.”    As we went on I noted that neither Radnor close by nor Mrs. Radnor on  the veranda seemed aware of anything remarkable in Pembroke’s attire;  they must be habituated by him to it or to similar or even more  fantastic raiment.    We appeared to walk the length or width of the village, to the villa  farthest from the beach. As we entered I had a glimpse on one hand  of a parlor with an ample round center-table, inviting armchairs and  walls lined with bookcases, through whose doors I espied some handsome  bindings; on the other hand of a cozy dining-room with a polished  table and beyond it a sideboard loaded with silverware and decorated  porcelain.    By the newel-post of the broad, easy stair stood a paragon of a Chinese  butler.    “Wu,” said Pembroke, “Mr. Denbigh is to occupy this house. Show him  to his bedroom and call Fong. Mr. Denbigh needs him at once. And tell  Fong that Mr. Denbigh has lost all his baggage and needs a change of  clothes promptly.”    Without any sudden movement or appearance of haste, without a word, he  turned and was out of the villa and away before I could speak.    I found myself domiciled in an abode delightfully situated, each  outlook a charming picture, and inside admirably designed and lavishly  provided with every imaginable comfort and luxury. The servants were  all Chinese. One took care of the lawn, flowers and shrubberies,  another swept the rooms; there was an unsurpassable Chinese cook,  whom I never saw, and something I heard made me infer that he had a  helper. I had at my beck a Chinese valet, a Chinese errand-boy and the  deferential butler, who managed the house and anticipated my every want.    Except for frequent baths I think I slept most of the ensuing  forty-eight hours. What I swallowed I took in bed. My second  breakfast on the island I ate in the dainty, exquisitely appointed  dining-room. After that I had energy enough to loll in one of the  rattan lounging-chairs on the veranda, comfortably clad in neat, cool,  well-cut, well-fitting garments chosen from the amazing abundance which  Fong had ready for me, how so exactly suitable for me I could not  conjecture. I had not been long on the veranda when Radnor strolled by,  whistling “The Carnival of Venice.” He came up and joined me. Early in  our chat he said:    “Probably you will be unable to refrain from asking questions; but I  fancy that I shall feel at liberty to answer very few of your queries.  Nearly everything I know about this island and about happenings on it  I have learned not as a mere man or as a mere dweller here, but as  Pembroke’s resident physician; it is all confidential. Most of what you  learn here you’ll have to absorb by observation and inference. And I  don’t mind telling you that the less you learn the better will Pembroke  be pleased, and I likewise.”    He did tell me that the villas were tenanted chiefly by the members of  Pembroke’s private orchestra and band, mostly Hungarians, Bohemians,  Poles and Italians, with such other satellites as a sculptor, an  architect, an engineer, a machinist, a head carpenter, a tailor and  an accountant. The other village was populated entirely by Asiatics,  Chinese, Japanese, Hindoos, and others; who performed all the labor of  the island.    The next morning, about the same time, as I was similarly lounging on  my veranda, Pembroke appeared, in the same bizarre attire, or lack of  attire, in which I had previously seen him. He sat with me a half hour  or so, asked courteously after my health and comfort and remarked:    “I am glad you feel contented: you’ll probably abide here some time.”    I said nothing. He glanced away from me, up under the edge of the  veranda roof through the overarching boughs. My eyes followed his. I  caught glints of pink from far-off flamingoes.    “Glorious birds!” Pembroke exclaimed, rapturously. “They nest on  several of the low outlying keys, which, with the coral-reefs scattered  between them, make it impossible for any craft bigger than a cat-boat  to approach this side of the island. They have multiplied amazingly  since I began shepherding them. I love them! I glory in them!”    At the word he left me, as abruptly and swiftly as after our first  encounter.    Thereafter, for some weeks of what I can describe only as luxuriously  comfortable and very pleasant captivity, I diverted myself by reading  the very well-chosen and varied books of the villa’s fairly large  library, by getting acquainted with the inhabitants of the other  villas, and by roaming about the lower part of the valley. The very  evening of our chat Radnor had invited me to dinner, for which Fong  fitted me out irreproachably, and at which I found Mrs. Radnor charming  and the other guests, Conway the architect, and his wife and sister,  very agreeable companions. After that I was a guest at dinner at one or  another of the villas each evening, so that I lunched and breakfasted  alone at my abode, but never dined there.    Once only I inspected the other village and found its neatness and  the apparent contentment of its inhabitants, especially the women and  children, very charming. But I seemed to divine that they felt the  presence of a European or American as an intrusion: I avoided the  village thereafter.    Some of the men of that village tended the trees, shrubberies, vines  and gardens of the valley, and kept it a paradise, luxuriant with every  sort of fruit and vegetable which could be grown in that soil and  climate.    I saw nothing more of Pembroke and found that I could not approach  his palace on the hill-top, for there was an extremely adequate steel  fence of tall L-irons, sharp at the top, across the valley and down  to the beach beyond either village, which barrier was patrolled by  heavily-built, muscular guards, seemingly Scotch and not visibly  armed, who respectfully intimated that no one passed any of its gates,  or along either beach, without Mr. Pembroke’s express permit. Very  seldom did I so much as catch a glimpse of Pembroke on the terraces  of his palace, but I did see on them knots, even bevies, of women  whose outlines, even at that distance, suggested that they were young  and personable, certainly that they were gayly clad in bright-colored  silks. Near or with them I saw no man, excepting Asiatic servitors, and  Pembroke himself, who powerfully suggested an oriental despot among his  sultanas.    By the inadvertent utterance of some one, I forget whom, I learned that  the guards had a cantonment or barrack on the other side of the island.    I enjoyed rambling about the valley, as far as I was permitted, for  both the variety and the beauty of its products were amazing.    Still more amazing to me was the number of ever-flowing ornamental  fountains. The Bahamas are proverbially hampered by scanty water  supply. But here I found, apparently, a superabundance of clear, pure,  drinkable water. There was a fountain near the village, where a seated  bronze figure, seemingly of some Asiatic god or saint unknown to me,  held in each hand a great serpent grasped by its throat, and from the  open mouth of each snake poured a spout of water into the basin before  the statue. There were other fountains, each with a figure or group of  figures of bronze, in the formal garden by the village of villas. And  beyond it, set against the scooped-out flank of one of the range of  enclosing hills, was a huge concrete edifice of basins and outstanding  groups of statuary and statues and groups in niches, more or less  reminiscent of the Fountain of Trevi. I was dumbfounded at the flow of  water from this extravagantly ornate and overloaded structure. There  were many jets squirting so as to cross each other in the air, even to  interlace, as it were. But midway of the whole construction, behind the  middle basin, was a sort of grotto with, centrally, an open entrance  like a low doorway or manhole, on either side of which were two larger  apertures like low latticed windows, filled in with elaborately  patterned bronze gratings, through the lower part of which flowed two  streams of water as copious as brooks, which cascaded into the main  basin.    Beyond this rococco fountain was a plot of ground enclosed by a hedge,  serving as garden for a tiny cottage of one low story. In it lived an  old Welsh woman, spoken of by the inhabitants of the village as “Mother  Bevan.” She always wore the hideous Welsh national costume and hobbled  about leaning on a stout malacca walking-stick with an ivory crosshead  tipped with gold bosses. She cared for and delighted in a numerous  flock of snow-white geese which somehow seemed thriving in this, one  would suppose, for them far too tropical climate. Among them was a  large and very handsome gander, which reminded me of my childhood’s  pet. The flock spent much of its time swimming and splashing in the  basins of the enormous grotto-fountain.    When I asked Radnor about the abundance of water and its apparent  waste, he said:    “No mystery there nor any secrets. Pembroke could spend anything he  pleased on wildcat artesian drilling and had the perverse luck to  strike a generous flow just as his drillers were about to tell him  that no humanly constructed implements could drill any deeper. It’s  no spouting well, though, and a less opulent proprietor than Pembroke  could not afford to pump it as he does. The power-station is on the  other side of the island, near the harbor. It uses oil fuel of some  kind. There is never any stint of water for any use and the surplus is  made to do ornamental duty, as you see.”    I was interested in the old Welsh woman and in her tiny cottage, so  oddly discordant with the Italianate concrete fountain near it and the  spacious villas not far off. Except the Asiatics of the village and the  barrier-guards I had found affable every dweller on the island; most of  them sociable. I accosted the grotesque old crone, as she leaned over  her gate and discovered in her the unexpected peculiarity that all her  answers were in rhyming lines, rather cleverly versified, which she  uttered, indeed, slowly, in a measured voice, but without the slightest  symptom of hesitation. Her demeanor was distinctly forbidding and her  words by no means conciliatory. I recall only one of her doggerels,  which ended our first interview:        “Man fallen out of the sky.      “God never intended us to fly.      “It’s impious to ascend so high.      “’Twas wicked of you ever to try.      “No lover of reprobates am I.”    Except for this queer old creature I encountered no unfriendly word  or look from any of my neighbors. I enjoyed the dinners to which I  was invited and liked my fellow-guests at them; indeed I disliked no  one with whom I talked; but, on the other hand, I was attracted to no  one, and, while I felt entirely welcome wherever I was invited and  altogether at my ease, and pleased to be invited again later, at no  household did I feel free to drop in at odd times for casual chat. I  found many congenial fellow-diners, but no one increasingly congenial,  no one who impressed me as likely to be glad to have me call uninvited.    Therefore, as I always loved the open air, as I somehow felt lonely  on my own veranda and nowhere intimate enough to lounge on any other,  I took to spending many hours of the mornings, before the heat of the  midday grew intense, out in the shade of the little park, to which I  was attracted by many of its charming features, especially by the pink  masses of flowering bougainvillea here and there through it. I always  carried a book, sometimes I read, oftener I merely gazed about at the  enchanting vistas, overhead at the uncountable flamingoes, or between  the trees out to seaward at the dazzling white heaps of billowy cumulus  clouds, like titanic snow-clad mountains, bulging and growing on the  towering thunder-heads forming against the vivid blue sky out over the  ocean.    I think it was on my second morning in the park that I caught a glimpse  of Mother Bevan crossing a path at some distance. Later I caught other  glimpses of her crossing other paths. Each morning I caught similar  glimpses of her. On the fifth or sixth morning I suddenly became  conscious of an inward impression that she was, again and again, making  the circuit of the park, circling about me as it were, like a witch  weaving a spell about an intended victim.    Next morning I affected an absorption in my book and kept an alert, and  I was certain, an imperceptible watch in all directions. I made sure  that Mother Bevan was indeed perambulating the outer portions of the  park, stumping along, leaning heavily on her cross-headed cane, and I  made sure also that after she had completed one circuit about me she  kept on her way and completed another and another.    I was curious, puzzled, incensed; derisive of myself for so much as  entertaining the idea of any one, in 1921, attempting witchcraft;  concerned for fear that my wits were addled; and, while unable to rid  myself of the notion, yet completely skeptical of any effect on me and  unconscious of any.    But, the very next day, seated on the same marble bench, by the same  fountain, among the same pink masses of bougainvillea in flower, I was  aware not only of Mother Bevan circumambulating the outskirts of the  park, but also of her numerous flock of noisy, self-important, white  geese waddling about, not far from me, and indubitably walking round  and round me in ever lessening circles, the big gander always nearest  me. At first I felt incredulous, then silly, then resentful. And, as  the gander, now and then honking, circled about me for the fifth or  sixth time, I became conscious of an inner impulse, of an all but  overmastering inner impulse, to seek out Pembroke and to tell him that  I was willing to do anything he wanted me to do; to pledge myself to do  anything he wanted me to do.    I took alarm. I felt, shamefacedly, but vividly, that I was being made  the subject of some sort of attempted necromancy. All of a sudden I  found myself aflame with resentment, with hatred of that gander. I  leapt to my feet, I hurled my book at him, I ran after him, I threw  at him my bamboo walking-stick, barely missing him. I retrieved the  walking-stick and pursued the retreating bird, and threw the cane at  him a second time, almost hitting him.    The geese half waddled, half flew towards the beetling atrocities of  the ornate rococco hill-side fountain; I followed, still infuriated.  There was, along the walk before the fountain, an edging of lumps of  coral rock defining the border of the flower-beds. I picked up an  armful of the smaller pieces of angular coral rock, chased the geese  into the big main basin of the fountain and pelted that gander with  jagged chunks of coral. He fled through the central manhole into the  grotto and hissed at me through one of the gratings, behind which he  was safe from my missiles.    Suddenly overwhelmed by a revulsion of shame and a tendency to laugh  at myself, I beat a retreat to my veranda. There I sat, pondering my  situation and my experiences.    I recalled that, at every dinner to which I had been invited, there  had been, practically, but two subjects of conversation: the boredom  of life on tropical islands in general and on Pembroke island in  particular; and the worth, the fine qualities, the charm, the  perfection of Pembroke himself.    I watched a chance to find Radnor at leisure, to waylay him, to entice  him to my veranda. When the atmosphere of our talk seemed auspicious, I  said:    “See here, Radnor! I know you said you meant to elude any queries I  might put to you, but there is one question you’ll have to answer,  somehow. Why are all these people here?”    “That is easy,” Radnor laughed. “I have no objection to answering that  question. They are here because Pembroke wants them here.”    “I didn’t phrase my question well,” I said, “but you know what I mean.  No one I have met really likes being here. Why do they stay?”    “That’s easy, too,” Radnor smiled. “Almost anyone will stay almost  anywhere if lodged comfortably and paid enough. Pembroke provides his  hirelings with an overplus of luxuries and is more than liberal in  payment.”    “That does not explain what intrigues me,” I pursued. “I haven’t yet  hit on the right words to express my idea. But you really understand  me, I think, though you pretend you don’t. All the inhabitants of these  villas are not merely uneasy, they are consciously homesick, acutely  homesick, homesick to a degree which no luxurious surroundings, no  prospective savings could alleviate. They are pining for home. What  keeps them here?”    “Put it down,” said Radnor, weightily, “to the unescapable charm of the  island. That keeps them here.”    “Did you say witchery or enchantment?” I queried, meaningly.    Radnor was emphatic.    “I said charm!” he uttered. “Let it go at that.”    “I am not in the least inclined,” I retorted, “to let it go at that. I  take it that this is no joke, certainly not anything to be dismissed by  a clever play on words. I insist on knowing what makes all these people  stay here. They all declare, at every opportunity, that they are dying  of ennui, that the climate is uncongenial, that they long for temperate  skies, for northern vegetation, for frosty nights. What keeps them  here?”    “I tell you,” said Radnor, “that, like me, most human beings will do  anything, anything lawful and reasonable, if paid high enough.”    “The rest aren’t like you,” I asserted. “You and Mrs. Radnor impress  me as free agents, doing, for a consideration, what you have been  asked to do, and what you both, after weighing the pros and cons, have  agreed to do. All the others, Europeans, Americans and Asiatics, except  Mother Bevan, appear like beings hypnotized and moving in a trance,  mere living automatons, without any will of their own, actuated solely  by Pembroke’s will; as much so as if they were mechanical dolls. They  impress me as being mesmerized or bewitched. I seriously vow that  I believe they have been subjected to some supernatural or magical  influence. They are as totally dominated by Pembroke as if they were  the ends of his fingers.”    Radnor looked startled.    “It will do no good,” I cried, “to contradict me or to deny it.”    “I believe you,” Radnor said, as if thinking out loud. He went on:    “You are right. Except Mother Bevan and me and Lucille every human  being on this island is completely under Pembroke’s influence, gained  largely through the help of Mother Bevan.”    “Why not you and your wife?” I queried.    “Lucille, because of me,” he replied. “Pembroke found out, by trying  Melville here and Kennard, that, after being put under his influence,  while retaining surgical skill, a physician loses all ability to  diagnose and prescribe. He had to ship Kennard and Melville back home,  and pension them till their faculties recovered their tone.”    I looked him straight in the eyes. He forestalled my impending outburst  by saying:    “As far as I can discern, Pembroke’s influence over his retainers does  them no harm, physical or mental. Kennard and Melville have as large  incomes and as many patients and are as successful and prosperous, as  popular and prominent among their fellow-physicians as if they had  never sojourned here. Except in their enthusiasm for and admiration of  Pembroke every human being on this island appears to me as healthy as  if not under any influence of any kind.”    “Even so,” I blurted out, “you ought not to abet any such deviltries.”    “I don’t admit,” said Radnor, hotly, “that any deviltries exist on  this island or that there is any approach to deviltry in what you have  partly divined. Also I abet nothing, as I ought, but, as I also ought,  I conceive that I am under obligations not to thwart Pembroke in any  way. I am the island’s resident physician and his personal physician;  I am here to treat injuries, cure maladies, relieve pain, and do all  I can to keep healthy every dweller on this island. I live up to my  conception of my duty. Don’t attempt to preach at me.”    “I am impatient,” I said, “at my enforced stay here, and revolted at  the idea of succumbing to Pembroke’s influence.”    Radnor laughed.    “You are,” he said, “the only human being who has reached the island,  since Pembroke bought it, uninvited. You’ll get away by and by. And you  are most unlikely to be affected by anything he or Mother Bevan may  have in their power to do. Neither Kennard nor Melville ever suspected  anything, or grew suspicious. You alone have half seen through the  situation here. You are Mother Bevan’s most refractory subject, so far.  Have no fear.”    He went off, whistling Strauss’ Blue Danube Waltz.    I had frequent and recurrent fears, but I dissembled them. I think,  among all the terrors which haunted me during the remainder of my  sojourn on the island, that I came nearest to panic and horror within  an hour after Radnor had left me. Hardly was he gone when Pembroke,  arrayed precisely as before and reminding me of a stage-frog in a  goblin pantomime, sauntered up and seated himself by me.    I sweated with tremors of dismay, I was ready to despair, when I found  myself, however I tried, unable to utter a word to him concerning the  gander, Mother Bevan, or my suspicions; unable even to allude to the  subject in any way, although he asked me bluntly:    “Have you anything to complain of?”    “Only that I am here,” I replied.    “I had nothing to do with your coming here,” he retorted. “You came  uninvited, of your own accord, or by accident. I trust I have been a  courteous host, but I have not tried to pretend that you are welcome.  I am endeavoring to arrange that your departure shall not entail upon  me any inconvenience or any danger of disadvantageous consequences.  Believe me, I am doing all I can to expedite your return to your  normal haunts. Meantime you’ll have to be patient.”    I was most impatient and very nearly frantic at finding myself, no  matter how I struggled inwardly, totally unable so much as to refer or  allude to what lay heaviest on my mind.    We exchanged vaguely generalized sentences for awhile and he left as  abruptly as before, left me quivering with consternation, dreading that  my inability to broach the subject on which I was eager to beard him  was a premonition of my total enthrallment to Pembroke’s influence.    As the days passed I became habituated to stoning that uncanny gander,  chasing him into the basin of the fountain and having him hiss at me  from behind one of the gratings; I became indifferent to the glimpses  I caught of Mother Bevan hovering in the middle distance. I had a good  appetite for my meals: in fact, the food set before me at my abode  would have awakened the most finicky dyspeptic to zest and relish, even  to voracity; while the dinners to which I was invited were delectable.    But from night to night I slept less and less, until I was near  insomnia. And, from day to day, I found it more and more difficult to  absorb myself in reading, to keep my mind on what I read; even to read  at all.    Again I waylaid Radnor. I described to him my progressively worsening  discomfort and distress.    “I am now,” I said, “or soon shall be, not merely in need of your help,  but beyond any help from you or anybody. If you don’t do something for  me I’ll go crazy, I’ll do something desperate, I’ll commit suicide.”    “I have been pondering,” he said, “how to help you, and I have almost  hit upon a method. Your condition does not yet justify my giving you  anything to make you sleep. As yet I do not want to give you any sort  of drug, not even the simplest sedative. Honestly try to get to sleep  to-night. Before to-morrow I think I’ll hit upon an entirely suitable  prescription, salutary for you and yet avoiding any appearance, any  hint, of my antagonizing Pembroke.”    I did try to sleep that night, but I was still wide awake long after  midnight. So tossing and turning on my comfortable bed, I heard outside  in the moonless darkness some one whistling a tune. As the sound came  nearer I made sure it was Radnor. Also I recognized the tune.    It was that of “The Ballad of Nell Flaherty’s Drake.”    The tune brought to my mind the words of the song’s refrain:                    “The dear little fellow,                  “His legs were so yellow,      “He could fly like a swallow and swim like a hake!                  “Bad luck to the tober,                  “The haythen cashlober,      “The monsther thot murthered Nell Flaherty’s drake!”    All of a sudden I conceived that this was Radnor’s method of intimating  to me by indirection what he did not dare to utter to me in plain  words. I thought I knew what he meant as well as if it had been put  into the plainest words. I rolled over, was asleep in three breaths,  and slept till Fong ventured to waken me.    After breakfast I went upstairs again and rummaged about in the closet  where Fong had deposited what I had worn when I came under his care. I  found there everything I remembered to have had about me. My automatic  was well oiled and in good working order and its clip of cartridges was  full. My belt, with the extra clips of cartridges, was as it had been  when I last put it on. I put it on, over my feather-weight hot-weather  habiliments; I strapped on my automatic; I strolled out, intent on  somehow coming within speaking distance of Pembroke.    Chance, or some unconscious whim, guided my footsteps to the beach and,  in spite of the rapidly intensifying heat of the sun rays, along it  to the remaining fragments of my wreck, barely visible under a great  accumulation of beach foam, left by the breakers, hurled shorewards  during the thunder storm which had raged while I slept.    Not far beyond those vestiges of what had been an aeroplane,  approaching me along the beach, I encountered Pembroke.    I found I had now no difficulty in speaking out my mind.    “Pembroke,” I said, “I’m outdone with confinement on this island of  yours. I’m irritated past endurance. If you don’t promptly speed me on  my way elsewhere the tension inside me is going to get too much for me.  Something inside me is going to snap and I’ll do something desperate,  something you’ll regret.”    He looked me straight in the eyes, handsome in his fantastic toggery;  calm and cool, to all appearance.    “Are you, by any chance,” he drawled, “threatening to shoot me?”    “I haven’t made any threats,” I retorted, hotly, “and I have no  intentions of shooting you or anybody. I realize that this island of  yours is part of the British Empire and that in no part of it are  homicides or murderous assaults condoned or left unpunished. But,  since you use the word ‘threat,’ I am ready to make a threat. If you  don’t soon set me free of my present captivity, if you don’t soon put  me in the way of getting home, I’ll not shoot you or any human being,  but I will shoot that devilish gander; and, I promise you, if I shoot  at him I’ll hit him and if I hit him I’ll kill him. I fancy those are  plain words and I conjecture that you understand me fully, with all the  implications of what I say.”    Pembroke’s expression of face appeared to me to indicate not only  amazement and surprise, but the emotions of a man at a loss and  momentarily helpless in the face of wholly unexpected circumstances.    “You come with me!” he snapped.    I followed him along the beach to the village, and, as we went,  wondered to see him apparently comfortable in his tight-fitting suit  and bare headed beneath the fierce radiance of the merciless sun rays,  while I rejoiced in my flimsy garments and at being sheltered under the  very adequate Panama I had chosen from the headgear Fong had offered me.    We passed the end of the steel picket fence, the two beach guards  saluting Pembroke, and, I thought, suppressing a tendency to grin at  me. Just around the point was a wide aviation field with a long row of  hangars opposite the beach. I marveled, for I had caught no glimpse of  any avion in the air over or about the island.    A half dozen Asiatics, apparently Annamites, rose as we approached and  stood respectfully, eyes on Pembroke. He uttered some sort of order in  a tongue unknown to me and two of them set wide open the doors of one  of the hangars. In it, to my amazement, I saw a Visconti biplane, one  of the fastest and most powerful single-seaters ever built.    “What do you think of that?” Pembroke queried.    “I am astonished,” I answered. “I was certain that no specimen of this  type of machine had ever been on this side of the Atlantic.”    “This is the first and only Visconti to be set up on this side of the  ocean,” he replied. “The point is; could you fly it?”    “I think I could,” I said, “and I am sure I could try.”    “Try then,” Pembroke snapped. “I make you a present of it. The sooner  you’re off and away the better I’ll be pleased.”    He spoke at some length, apparently in the same unknown tongue, and  strode off towards his palace.    I spent that day and most of the next going over that Visconti biplane,  with the deft, quick assistance of the docile Annamites. If there was  anything about it defective, untrustworthy or out of order I could not  find it. On the third morning (I had dined at Radnor’s both evenings),  equipped admirably by Fong, who instantly provided me with whatever I  asked for, I rose in that Visconti biplane, and, contrary to my fears,  reached Miami in safety. But I was so overstrained by anxiety that it  required six weeks in a sanitarium to make me myself again. During  those, apparently, endless hours in the air I had been expecting every  moment that something cunningly arranged beforehand and undiscoverable  to my scrutiny in my inspections and reinspections, was going to go  wrong with my conveyance and instantaneously annihilate me. The strain  all but finished me. However, all’s well that ends well.
