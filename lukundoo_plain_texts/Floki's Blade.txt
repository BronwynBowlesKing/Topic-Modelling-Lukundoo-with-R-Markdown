FLOKI’S BLADE                                         I      THORKELL VILGERDSON was not only reputed the handsomest youth in all  Norway, but was famous as a redoubtable champion, who had unfailingly  killed his man in every combat, and who was so skillful with weapons  that he had never been seriously wounded in any of the countless  affrays in which he had taken part. Therefore, although every one of  the thirty-nine other men on the Sea-Raven hated him venomously, not  one challenged him, or provoked him, or affronted him in any way, but  all were most scrupulously civil.    They all hated him. The three chieftains, Halfdan Ingolfson, Kollgrim  Erlendson, and Lodbrok Isleifson, who owned the ship and had planned  the adventure, hated him because, to their incredulous amazement, they  found themselves indubitably afraid of him. Their six thralls, Vifill,  Ulf, Hundi, Kepp, Sokholf and Erp, hated him, even more than they hated  their own masters, for his air of ineffable superiority. The twenty-six  other Vikings hated him because they felt themselves his inferiors and  were unwilling to acknowledge it, even in their thoughts. Most of all  his four perfidious sham friends, Hrodmar Finngerdson, Sigurd Atlison,  Gellir Kollskeggson and Bodvar Egilson, who had hatched the plot to  lure him to his doom and put him out of the way, and had enticed him to  join the expedition, hated him for his beauty, his grace, his jaunty  demeanor and his vivacious wit. Attack him they dared not, and, sulking  inwardly, they bided their time, outwardly suave and smiling, but with  furtive winks at each other.    Their opportunity came after a storm which drove them, they knew not  where or whither, for, in those times, stars were the mariners’ only  guides. Throughout three nights and three days they saw neither star  nor sun; in fact, could see barely two ships’ lengths through the  driving scud and sluicing rain; and all that time they dared not set so  much as a rag of sail, but, taking turns, every man of them, thralls,  warriors and chieftains alike, with but brief snatches of uneasy  sleep, labored mightily at the oars, to keep the ship head to gale,  or bailed furiously to keep her afloat. So terrific was the tempest  that Kollgrim, their acknowledged leader, was unwilling to relinquish  the helm and clung to it until exhaustion compelled him to rest. Even  when he signalled for a relief neither Halfdan nor Lodbrok showed  any alacrity for undertaking his momentous task. As they hesitated,  although only for an instant, Thorkell seized the tiller just as  Kollgrim’s grasp loosened. So well did he steer, so completely did  he justify his reputation as a seaman, that thereafter it was rather  Kollgrim who acted as relief to him than he to Kollgrim: every man of  them all, Kollgrim included, felt safer with Thorkell at the helm.    An hour or two before sunset of the long northern day the storm blew  itself out, the sky cleared, and the wind slackened and shifted to a  fair breeze. They stepped their mast, hoisted their yard, set a full  sail, and, Halfdan at the tiller, and Lodbrok on lookout at the prow,  the rest feasted. Champing and munching unhurriedly they despatched a  vast quantity of food, washed down with copious drafts of mead. When no  one could swallow another mouthful, Sigurd took the helm and Bodvar the  lookout’s place, and, while Halfdan and Lodbrok ate, the rest disposed  themselves to sleep, most of them to larboard, on the spare oars and  coils of rope, under the rowing-benches.    During the brief northern night Sigurd and Bodvar set the Sea-Raven  on a true course by a whole skyful of brilliant constellations,  but, before dawn, they saw the stars hidden all round the horizon  and gradually higher up, until only a few showed blurredly directly  overhead; so that, when the sleepers waked, they found themselves  enveloped in dense fog, and, soon after dawn, the wind slackened until  they had to man the oars to keep headway on the ship. The weary thralls  and Kollgrim roused last. After Kollgrim waked Thorkell was the only  sleeper and he slept heavily, exhausted by his overexertion at the  tiller.    Eyeing him as he lay on a coil of rope, Hrodmar and Gellir beckoned  Sigurd and Bodvar. They resigned their posts to willing reliefs and  picked their way amidships over and among the resting men and toiling  rowers. Kollgrim, Lodbrok and Halfdan joined them and the seven  conferred. All conned Thorkell and all agreed that he was fast asleep  and far from rousing. Then the three chieftains beckoned their six  thralls and instructed them. Erp and Ulf took convenient lengths of  ratline and knotted in each a clean-running noose. Vifill paired with  Hundi and Sokholf with Kepp, each pair choosing a length of light rope,  thicker than a big man’s thumb. Cautiously the six crawled towards  Thorkell, every man aboard, except a few sleepers and such oarsmen  as were abaft of Thorkell’s position, watching their approach with  malicious relish. Hundi and Vifill slipped their rope under Thorkell’s  knees; Kepp and Sokholf took a turn with theirs round his ankles,  Ulf and Erp each noosed a wrist: when all six were ready they looked  towards Kollgrim, and, at his nod, the two nooses tightened and the  ropes were knotted fast round Thorkell’s knees and ankles. Even that  did not waken him and, as Erp and Ulf pulled their cords and dragged  his arms wide, his four pretended friends sprang on him, turned him  on his face, and, after a violent struggle, for, even with knees and  ankles lashed, Thorkell fought like a wildcat, they pinioned his arms  behind him and turned him once more face upward, trussed and helpless.    Then they gloated over him, told him what they really thought of  him, and insulted him to their hearts’ content. Halfdan, who was an  acclaimed skald, composed and chanted over him an impromptu drapa of  triumph. Even the thralls expressed their envious malignity. Gellir  proposed to run him through and Bodvar to throw him overboard. But  Kollgrim demurred. The thirty-four freemen had taken oath to a pledge  of mutual fellowship, as was customary in all Viking voyages, and he  pointed out that they were bound, all of them, by their oath and must  keep its letter, if not its spirit.    Lodbrok thereupon suggested that they set him adrift, bound as he was,  in their smallest boat, which had been half stove during the storm  and was presumably leaky; putting into it with him a small hide flask  of water and one smoked fish. Then they could accuse him of wilful  desertion.    By then it was nearer noon than sunrise, but no sight of the sun had  they had, nor could any man, in that fog, conjecture the sun’s place in  the sky. Their outlook was all gray mist and smooth groundswell, for  there was not a catspaw of breeze.    From the boat they took its sail, mast and oars; but they did not  search it carefully. In it they laid a leather flask of water and two  little smoked fish. In it they laid Thorkell, trussed as he was, but,  as they launched the boat, Kollgrim cut the ropes at his knees and  ankles.    As boat and ship drifted apart his enemies mocked him, their grinning  faces peering between and over the shields which lined the low rail.    “Hoist your sail!” Bodvar jeered at him, “and make for Norway or  Iceland, as you prefer. You are about as far from the one as from the  other. You have no worse or better chance, either way.”    “Hope you relish your provender!” Gellir called.    “You’ll need both oars soon,” Hrodmar shrilled, “and I don’t see  either.”    “Don’t you wish you had a bailer!” Sigurd shouted.    Soon he saw only fog.    He eyed the dirty water sloshing about in the dory’s bilge. The boat  was not leaking rapidly, but it was leaking. No water had lapped  over the gunwales and the big groundswells were long and smooth. Of  air there was not a breath. For the time being he had only the leaks  to fear. And, in the bow, jammed under the tiny fore-thwart in the  triangular cubby-hole, he saw a small wooden scoop-bailer. It meant  more to him than the two little fish and the leather water-bottle under  the after thwart.    He conned the edges of the gunwales and thwarts. He saw two sharp  splinters. The larger and sharper was where he could not use it; but,  painfully and with great exertion, he wriggled, hunched and wrenched  himself until he brought the cords which bound his wrists against  the other splinter. With efforts distressing at once, and not long  afterwards agonizing, he sawed the rope against the splinter. Panting,  a jelly of exhaustion, shivering and sweating, he all but fainted; but  he found fresh energy every time he glanced at the bilge-water.    At last, just as hope and strength together were failing him, the cord  parted. A few jerks and twists of his arms and hands and they were  free. He shook himself, beat his arms against his chest and sprang  upon the bailer. To his great satisfaction it was not long before no  deftness could scoop it up half full; the boat was not leaking too fast  for him.    As the dense fog and breathless calm continued to brood over the waters  and the slow groundswell even abated, his cockleshell kept afloat not  only all that day and night, but throughout the two following days  and nights. But the third night after he had been set adrift found  him near exhaustion. More than half his time was occupied in bailing  and his muscles ached. He was afraid to sleep for fear of foundering  before he woke. Once, in spite of himself, he fell deeply asleep and  roused to find the gunwales almost awash, so that the most desperate  fury of bailing barely sufficed to save him. In the flurry of effort  his remaining fish went overboard in a scoopful of water, unheeded. His  flask he had emptied by dusk of the second day, control himself all he  could.    As the slow dawn whitened the fog after the short arctic night he  thought he was delirious, for he seemed to hear the roar of surf on  rocks and not far off.    Then, suddenly, all at once, the fog thinned, sunrays lanced the  last wisps of it, the air cleared, he saw the sun plain, saw the sky  cloudless, saw the horizon all round and beheld, close to him and  opposite the just-risen sun, a rocky coast.    Instantly he realized that his enemies had been vastly in error as to  the position of the Sea-Raven and had set him adrift only a few leagues  east of Iceland. In spite of his buzzing head, his parched mouth, his  shivering and trembling limbs, his general faintness, he felt new vigor  infused all through him. With his pitiful beechen scoop he alternately  bailed and paddled. The current, he felt, was drawing him towards the  cliffs. He saw a headland close. With his bailer he strove to guide the  skiff towards it. The currents were kind and towards that headland he  drifted. He saw no beach, but many flat-topped rocks just awash, some  hardly wet by the lazy surges. Between them and him he saw no broken  water. If his boat dashed into or scraped against a rock he might leap  to it without a ducking.    Actually he had the luck to achieve just that and saw his boat stove  and smashed after he had firm footing on almost dry basalt.    He stood in his doublet, hose and brogues, with only his inner girdle,  without belt, mantle, sword, dagger, or even belt-knife. Everything on  him was damp from the fog and the splashing of his long bailing; but,  though his teeth chattered in the chilly morning air, doubly chilly to  him after the milder temperature out at sea, he was not the half-frozen  waif he would have been if he had had to swim ashore.    To his left, to southwards, the cliffs seemed beaten by the surf.  Before him, to westwards, he thought he espied a bit of beach not far  ahead. To his right, northwards, he seemed to descry a headland afar  across a fiord. He walked westwards, swaying, tottering, stumbling,  even staggering, but keeping his feet. Gulls and other sea-fowl  wheeled and screamed above and about him. Not a hundred paces from his  landing-place he came upon a little rill trickling down a nook in the  cliff. He knelt and scooped up a handful of icy water. Then he lay  beside the rivulet and counted a slow hundred between each handful of  the water and the next. Before his thirst was entirely quenched he  stood up.    Then he scanned the rocks for birds’ nests. He saw many; but, of the  scores of eggs he broke, but one was eatable. This he sipped and slowly  swallowed its contents. He felt new life all over him.    Not stumbling now he stepped heedfully forward. He felt strangely large  and light and whatever he gazed at looked dim and vague. But he felt  really able to walk. He rounded a jutting elbow of the cliff.    Before him, irradiated by the slant sunrays, he saw three handsome  young noblewomen, walking arm in arm. All were bareheaded, each with  a forehead-ribbon round her flowing hair. The middlemost was tall,  full-contoured, with very black locks. She was enveloped in a crimson  mantle. The girl on her right was of medium height, slender, with  glossy brown tresses and wore a mantle of dark blue. The third was  small and very lovely, her hair golden, her cheeks pink, her eyes blue,  all set off by a mantle of bright grass-green.    Thorkell thought them norns come to escort him to Valhalla. A cloud,  gray and then inky black, swept between him and his outlook. He felt  himself topple.                                        II      When Thorkell came to himself he was in bed in the pitch dark. He felt  about him and found that he was in a sort of bunk, a wall on his right  hand and, on his left, a polished board. He ran his hand along its  upper edge. He was rather deep down in his berth and under him was an  infinity of yielding feather-bed. He was well covered with warm quilts.  He tried to stretch, but the space was too short for him. He composed  himself and slept again.    When he woke the second time it was daylight and he saw by his bunk a  tall, spare, elderly noblewoman, severe-looking, hatchet-faced, with a  lean and stringy neck and gray hair. She was clad in garments of undyed  wool of the usual rusty brown.    “Son,” she warned him, “you must not try to speak. Drink this slowly.”    And, as he weakly tried to raise himself in the wall-bed, she supported  him with her right arm, at the same time holding to his lips with  her left hand a silver goblet. Thorkell tasted a delicious posset,  compounded of milk, mead, honey, barley-meal, and of other ingredients  unknown to him. He swallowed most of it, fell back among his down  pillows and slept again at once.    His third waking was again in full daylight. He felt more like himself.  He saw that his bed occupied most of one side of a fair-sized room,  wainscoted in dark wood and with a low ceiling, similarly panelled.  Opposite his bunk stood a high, narrow table. In the wall by the foot  of his bunk was a low doorway, its door shut. In the opposite wall  was a window, whose contracted casements had small panes of fish-gut  membrane, stretched across wooden lattices. The panes were bright with  the glare of brilliant sunshine full on them and much light filtered  through, so that the room was well-lighted. By his bed, facing the  window, in one of the two chairs, sat a tall, magnificently dignified,  elderly man, gray-haired, ruddy of complexion, broad-shouldered,  wrapped in a reddish-brown mantle of fine wool. He wore a gold  neck-chain from which hung a large, flat, oval gold amulet-case.    “Son,” he said, “you must not yet attempt to speak. Hearken and  remember. You are housed at Hofstadir, on Revdarfiord, by Faskrudness,  on the east coast of Iceland. I, Thorstein Vilgerdson, am master of  Hofstadir. We know nothing of you except that my daughter and my two  nieces found you early in the morning, day before yesterday, on the  strand by Faskrudness. My wife has been caring for you and she now  tells me that you will soon be able to be up and about. Only after you  are well and strong will I permit you to tell your story. Meanwhile you  are our guest. Do as I bid you. Be silent, compose your mind, repose  yourself, and help my wife to restore you to strength and vigor. When  you are yourself we shall talk again. Now sleep.”    Thorkell was compliantly mute and his host rose and left him.    Two mornings later Thorkell woke to find Thorstein again seated by his  bed. And he saw, on the table opposite his bed, a tray with a goblet  and a hunch of bread on it.    “Son,” the old man queried, “are you entirely awake?”    After Thorkell’s affirmation Thorstein said:    “My wife judges that you are now sufficiently recovered to tell your  story. But you had best first fortify yourself with some food.”    And he himself rose and fetched the tray from the table. Thorkell  acquiesced and swallowed a few mouthfuls. Then he settled himself back  on his pillows, his host resumed his armchair, and Thorkell began his  story by naming himself.    “A Vilgerdson!” the old man exclaimed, “and from Rogaland! We must be  cousins, however distant. In my long life I have never known or heard  of any Norwegian Vilgerdsons; as far as my knowledge goes our family  has long been wholly Icelandic. We are descended from Floki Vilgerdson,  of Rogaland, the first voyager who ever wintered in Iceland. A hundred  and thirty-six years ago he sailed past the headlands of Faxafloi and  wintered in the Breidifiord. But he and his associates were so carried  away by the abundance of fish and the ease of catching them that  they neglected to cure enough hay and their live-stock all perished.  Therefore he sailed home next spring. But, twenty and more years  later, when past middle age, after most of the west and north of  Iceland had already been settled, Floki returned and chose a home here  in the east on this very spot. I am his great-great-great-grandson and  heir to him and all his.”    “I,” said Thorkell, “am great-great-great-great-grandson to Snorri  Vilgerdson, younger brother to Floki the Viking and settler. For both  were sons of Vilgerd Vilgerdson of Rogaland.”    “Then,” said his host, “you are a fourth cousin to my children and they  are your fourth cousins. You are one of us. And now tell me your story.”    When Thorkell had said his say and had answered all his host’s  questions the old man said:    “My wife opines that it will now benefit you to be out of bed and in  the open air. My younger sons, Thorgils and Thorbrand, will help you to  dress and will assist you to walk about, for, although you may resent  the suggestion, you are not yet strong enough for it to be well for you  to attempt walking unassisted.”    And he called his sons, handsome youths, who clasped hands with  Thorkell, called him “cousin” after their father’s explanation, and,  when the old man had gone out, assisted him to rise. He found he  needed assistance. They helped him to don a shirt of the finest linen,  knitted hose of soft wool, noblemen’s shoes, a doublet of the best  woolen cloth, and a fine crimson mantle of wool delightful to feel and  handle. They girded him with an outer belt, but there was no sign of  sword-belt, sword, poniard or knife. Each of them wore a belt-knife  with a staghorn heft, and a dagger and sword, with steel guards and  hilts of walrus ivory, pommelled with gold.    One on each side of him they supported him as he strove to stand and  they guided him through the doorway into a spacious, plank-floored,  high-raftered hall, lighted by many small windows placed high up in  the tall gable-ends; low, narrow doors were all down both long sides,  with an ample fireplace in a big chimney-piece midway of one side; at  one end was the main doorway, at the other a door almost as large.  His helpers conducted him out through the main doorway and to a bench  in the sunlight where they seated him. Thorbrand sat by him, Thorgils  walked away.    Thorkell found the cool, soft breeze invigorating and yet mild, for  it was near midsummer and as genial as it ever is in Iceland. The  slant sunrays warmed him. He basked and gazed about him. He saw  close by a strongly built storehouse of stone and great ash beams,  high-gabled, though its roof was not as steep and tall as that of the  mansion. Further away he made out a big sheepfold, with sheds, a large  cattle-byre, an ample stable and two very large barns. In whatever  direction he looked the extensive level space in which the buildings  were grouped was bounded by a stone wall, breast-high, and not of  boulders, but of roughly squared blocks.    Some two hundred yards or more distant, topping a low hill, was  a temple; for, with its great size, its high and steep roof, its  scalloped shingles, its horse-head and fish-tail ornaments at the  ridge-pole ends and eave-ends, its carven gable-ends, it could be  nothing else.    Some of the thralls were busy about the buildings and several  maid-servants passed in and out. Thorkell saw no men-at-arms, nor any  of the family except the two brothers. Thorbrand sat smiling, but  mute. Thorkell kept mute and basked. After a time Thorgils came back  and Thorbrand strolled away. When Thorbrand returned he said:    “Mother thinks that you were best back in your bed.”    Thorkell acquiesced and suffered himself to be escorted indoors. In bed  he ate some food brought by a tow-headed serving-maid. Soon he slept.    He woke near dusk of the long northern day and again ate what the same  maid brought him and was again soon asleep.    Next morning Thorstein was again sitting by him when he woke. As before  he enquired how he felt and himself served him with food and drink.  When he had reset the tray on the table and reseated himself he said:    “Young man, I and my family have talked over you and your story. I and  my daughter and my nieces believe you. But all five of my sons, my two  daughters-in-law, my accountant, my seneschal, my skald and everyone  of my men-at-arms are convinced that you are not a castaway from any  ship, though likely enough a Norwegian and no Icelander. They are  unanimously of the opinion that you are a spy craftily insinuated into  our community by our enemies. They point out that your clothing was dry  when you were carried in here: that neither it nor your hair showed any  signs of your having been swimming; that such a marvel as your having  leapt ashore from a ship’s-boat drifting without sail, oars or rudder  is too improbable for them to believe it other than a clumsy invention.  They all insist that I would imperil myself and all my household if  I were to accept your story and keep you here as a guest. My word is  law here, but I feel that it would be unwise for me to disregard so  unanimous, so insistent and so clamorous a dissent from my views.    “Now, young man, if you have in fact been sent here by the  Miofifirthers or the Seydisfirthers you had best admit it at once and  make a clean breast of the whole matter. You shall not be harmed in any  way. I will have you fed and cared for until you are fit for a short  journey, and then I will equip you with flint and steel, a belt-knife,  a dagger, a sword and sword-belt, a horseman’s cloak, a good horse,  well bitted, saddled and girthed, and a supply of food; and I will  send a thrall to guide you round the head of Revdarfiord and to speed  you on your way. But if you are what you assert you are and claim our  protection and hospitality as the dues of a castaway, you must convince  all my household of the truth of your tale.”    “I am Thorkell Vilgerdson of Rogaland in Norway,” he replied. “I know  nothing of any Miofifirthers or Seydisfirthers or of any foes of yours.  I never set foot on Iceland until I leapt ashore from my drifting boat  soon after sunrise of the morning on which I encountered your daughter  and nieces. I have never, in Iceland, set eyes on any Icelanders except  members of your household. What I have told you is true in every  particular. But how may I convince you of its truth?”    “As you must know from my name and my sons’ names,” Thorstein answered,  “we are steadfast adherents of the old faith. Those who suspect you,  and my wife, the most embittered of those against you, in particular,  would be at once convinced if you take formal oath to the truth of  your statements, an oath sworn upon your own blood and the sacred  ring of our holy temple, calling Thor and Odin to witness. If you are  willing to take oath, as I suggest, no one here will any longer doubt  you.”    “I am entirely willing,” Thorkell declared. “I am more than willing,  I am eager. The suspicions of your household are natural, if you have  crafty enemies near at hand and live under threat of being raided. I  will swear as you suggest.”    “I infer,” said Thorstein, “that you also, then, like all here at  Hofstadir, are a firm believer in the gods of our fathers.”    “I am indeed,” Thorkell affirmed.    “Have you met Christians?” his host queried.    “Too many,” said Thorkell, “too many by far.”    “Have you talked with any about their beliefs?” the old man inquired.    “With many,” Thorkell said.    “And what do you think of them?” Thorstein pressed him.    “It seems to me,” said Thorkell, “that they claim to have a system  of sorcery and magic far more efficacious and far cheaper than ours.  That is about all I can gather from their talk. Their religion costs  far less than ours because they hold that no blood-sacrifices are  necessary, stating that one man, hundreds of years ago, achieved one  sacrifice by which all men may benefit forever, no other being required  after that one. How this could be or can be I cannot conceive. But such  appears to be their view. Then they seem to think that priests can be  largely dispensed with: certainly they have far fewer than we and their  priests are cheaper to maintain than ours, as they require less in  the way of ornaments, raiment, food and servants. Then, though no one  of them has conveyed to me what they mean, they all allege that their  invocations win surer and more effective responses than those which  we receive from our deities. That is all I can make out about their  novelties.”    “Your impressions,” Thorstein said, “tally with mine. Christians are  utterly incomprehensible to me. In particular, they all rant about  peace on earth and good-will to men. Yet, since they became Christians,  the Miofifirthers and the Seydisfirthers are just as implacably hostile  to us here as before. My father repeatedly made overtures to them  proposing conferences to negotiate for a reconciliation, for mutual  concessions, for laying our differences and the damage done to each  side before the Althing for reference to the courts and for a decision  and settlement, for a termination of the feud and the establishment of  harmony and amity. I have made similar proffers. But they have been  inexorably hostile. In fact, since they became Christians, they seem,  if possible, even more ferocious, rancorous and blood-thirsty than  before.”    “That,” said Thorkell, “is just about the attitude towards us heathen  of all the Christians I have ever met or heard of. Their idea of peace  is unqualified submission or total extermination for us, and complete  triumph and unquestioned domination for themselves. Not one will listen  to proposals of compromise, accommodation or mutual forbearance. They  seem to me opinionated, bigoted, fanatical, overbearing and arrogant.  We must fight or perish, there appears to be no other way.”    “You speak sensibly, my son, it seems to me,” the old man said. “You  have convinced me that you are sincere. Your oath in the temple will  convince all my household and all my retainers.”    Then he rose and went out.                                        III      Again Thorgils and Thorbrand entered the bedroom and helped Thorkill  to dress. This time he needed little assistance. And this time they  girt him with a sword-belt, and equipped him with a handy belt-knife,  a fine dagger and a sword in a decorated scabbard. Out they escorted  him, Thorkell now walking easily and unaided. In the open he found  awaiting him Thorstein, his three elder sons, Thorfinn, Thorgeir and  Thord; a handsome and very blond young giant who was presented to  him as “Finnvard Sigurdson, of Faskrudsfiord, my future son-in-law,”  Thorstein’s house-skald, Olmod Borkson; and his seneschal, Ari Gormson.  There were a score of men-at-arms lounging about.    After the presentations they set off towards the temple, Thorstein  linking arms with Thorkell and leading the way.    “I myself,” he said, “am Gothi of this temple, which my grandfather,  Thorleif Vilgerdson, built with timber fetched from Norway.”    The temple, Thorkell judged, was a full hundred feet long. Temple  fashion the end under the gable which they approached was doorless. The  side-wall had two ample doorways, each near an end. They passed in by  that nearest them towards the right end of the side-wall, and turned  to their left. In behind them straggled the men-at-arms, who had  trooped after them. Thorkell could feel the reverential awe with which  the great, hulking, burly, truculent spearmen entered the holy place.  Midway of the opposite long-wall they passed the High-Seat, between the  tall pillars, each with its three consecrated bolts of gilded bronze.  They were visible even in the dim light afforded by the small latticed  windows, gut-paned, high up in the gable ends. Towards the end of the  temple they entered the oval, defined by a ring of thin slabs of stone  set on edge. Inside the oval, near the end of it towards the further  gable of the building, was an altar of the customary form, a great  thick slab of dressed stone, full three ells square, supported by four  stone posts, squared, carved with runes, and set deep in the beaten  earth floor. The slab of the altar was also carved with runes. On it  lay the great holy ring, of solid silver, weighing full thirty pounds.    Thorstein lifted the great ring and slid it up his right arm to the  shoulder. There Thorfinn tied it with a crimson wool ribbon, slipped  under his father’s left arm-pit and crossed on his left shoulder;  so that the ring would not slide down the arm. Then, standing on  Thorstein’s right, Thorkell unsheathed his dagger and with its  point lightly slashed the back of his left hand, tilting it till  the dagger-blade ran with blood. Then, placing his left hand on the  temple-ring and holding the dagger point down over the center of the  altar, he swore:    “As my blood drips upon this altar from the point of this dirk, so may  my blood and the heart’s blood of all my kin, of any wife I may wed, of  any children I may have, of all those dear to me, be spilt upon the  earth, if my oath is not truthful. I swear by my own blood, by the holy  ring which I grasp, by this altar, by the pillars of the High Seat, by  their sacred bolts, before Thor and Odin, that I am Thorkell Vilgerdson  of Rogaland in Norway, and that I am newly castaway on the coast of  Iceland and have never, in Iceland, seen or spoken with any Icelander  excepting dwellers here at Hofstadir.    “If my oath is false may my heart’s blood and the blood of all those  dear to me be spilt upon the earth as my blood now drips from the point  of my dirk. Before Odin and Thor I have sworn.”    Thereafter Thorfinn removed the Gothi’s ring from his father’s arm and  he and Thorstein laid it in its place midway of the altar-slab.    Outside the temple Thorgils dressed the slash on the back of Thorkell’s  left hand. Then Thorstein first and after him his sons in the order of  their ages, clasped hands with Thorkell, each uttering the formula:    “You are our dear and trusted cousin.”    Finnvard followed. Then Ari, Olmod and the men-at-arms saluted  Thorkell, crying:    “We are brothers in arms.”    From the temple Thorstein led Thorkell into the storehouse and into  that part of it which was used as an armory.    “Look over these weapons,” he said, “and select a sword, poniard and  belt-knife to your mind. Try first those you now have; if they suit  you, keep them. But be sure that the balance of the sword is precisely  what you prefer and that you are armed as you desire.”    Outside, in the mild sunshine of a day unusually mellow for Iceland,  they sat on the benches flanking the doorway and chatted until after  midday. Then Thorstein cautioned Thorkell that a man who had been  exposed and exhausted as he had had best lie down an hour or so before  his first heavy meal after his privations.    When Thorgils wakened and summoned him he found in the great hall  a numerous assemblage. He was presented by Thorstein to Thorkatla  his wife, to his daughter Thorgerd and his two nieces Thorarna and  Thordis, whom he had encountered on the beach. Thorarna was the tall,  full-contoured, black-tressed beauty, and Thordis the exquisite blonde  whom he had thought the most beautiful of the three. Thorfinn’s wife  Arnora and Thord’s wife Valdis were personable young women.    Thorstein occupied the High Seat, facing the fireplace. To the left and  right of him sat his family, on benches ranged along that side of the  hall, but far enough from the wall to leave space for anyone to walk  behind them and to pass in or out of any door. On the opposite side of  the hall, flanking the chimney-piece, was a similar row of benches,  occupied by the men-at-arms, more than forty together. Towards the ends  of the hall sat such dependents and thralls as were not busy serving  the feast. The servitors carried in more than eighty light, collapsible  tables, each in three parts, a square top and two trestles. One was  placed before each diner. The fare was varied and abundant, but notably  characteristic of Iceland. There were unlimited supplies of fresh  whey in jars, pitchers and bowls; bowls of curd; platters heaped with  slices of cheese, both new and aged; there was even an overabundance  of smoked and fresh fish, cooked in every known manner; plenty of  tender fat mutton, beef and veal, and, each borne in by two brawny  thralls, two great platters, one piled with convenient cuts of stewed  horseflesh, the other with similar collops of horseflesh roasted. There  was a moderate supply of manchets of excellent rye, barley and wheaten  bread, handed along in smallish flat osier baskets or on similar trays.  Maids continually passed and repassed proffering basins of warm water  and towels; for, in those days, forks were unknown, and, besides plates  and spoons of beechwood from Norway and belt knives, fingers were the  only table implements, and frequent washing of the hands was necessary  for comfort.    Thorgils and Thorbrand, between whom Thorkell sat, plied him with  offerings of every viand brought in and saw that his goblet was kept  full of well-aged, fragrant mead. Even more than the large household  and lavish fare Thorkill was impressed by the chimney-piece, which  faced him on his left, and by its fireplace, not aglow with smouldering  peat, but ablaze with a generous heap of crackling driftwood. He  commented on this to Thorbrand.    “I have never seen any other chimney or fireplace except ours,” was his  reply. “It is said that two halls in the river-valleys about Faxafloi  have chimney fireplaces, and that there is another in a mansion on  Breidifiord. But none of us have seen any. My great grandfather had  this built of native stone, for there is much fire-resisting rock on  our island.”    “This,” Thorkell said, “is the only chimney fireplace I have myself  ever seen. My home, like every other hall I have ever entered till  now, has only a fireplace midway of its floor, so that the smoke  blackens the rafters before it finds the hole in the roof.”    After the feast Thorstein called for silence.    “We have with us,” he said, “what is almost as good as a visiting  skald, a guest who has had marvellous adventures. All of us will now  listen to Thorkell Vilgerdson of Rogaland in Norway, if he will be so  good as to accede to my request that he tell us of his dangers and of  his escape.”    Thorkell blushed, but was encouraged by the smiling, eager faces turned  towards him. He took courage, stood up, and told his tale, haltingly at  first, later more fluently.    After he had finished and sat down Olmod twanged his harp and recited  a drapa describing and praising the exploits of Floki Vilgerdson the  viking and settler. When he ceased the company dispersed to bed.    During the ensuing days Thorkell became well acquainted with Hofstadir,  its denizens and its neighborhood. As soon as he felt his full strength  and vigor return he spent his mornings with Thorgir, Thorbrand,  Thorgils and Finnvard at fencing, target practice with spears or  arrows, wrestling, and other such manly exercises. At all of these  he excelled, yet his genial demeanor was so winsome that his easy  victories gave no offence to his companions.    They also went swimming together, and fishing, both in the many nearby  streams, and offshore in a very handy small boat, heavily built, blunt  bowed, yet a good sailor. Thorkell was amazed at the numbers of fish  and at the rapidity with which they could be caught. A hook thrown  into the water was taken almost at once.    They rode about the neighborhood on fine mounts, for, in those early  days, Icelandic horses were still fully equal to Norwegian horses, as  the breed was kept up by constant importations of tall, strong, speedy  and spirited stallions.    After not many days Thorkell learned the country further afield, for  he was invited to accompany Thorstein on a tour of inspection of his  district; for he was not only Gothi, that is, priest, of the temple at  Hofstadir, but also Gothi, that is, magistrate, of a district called a  gothorth, all Iceland being divided into gothorths. Thorstein made his  tour attended by his five sons; by several cousins, among whom were  Thorlak Vilgerdson of Thelmark and Thorvald Vilgerdson of Husavik;  by many thingmen, dependents and yeomen; and by a strong guard of  well-horsed spearmen.    Thorkell was much edified by Thorstein’s promptness at settling  controversies and redressing grievances. The old man displayed an  uncanny intuition and seemed to know all his vassals’ thoughts,  motives, wants, desires and needs without being told.    After the tour was over, at a moment when Thorstein was at ease,  Thorkell ventured to express his admiration.    His host smiled.    “A chieftain,” he said, “must possess the faculty of seeing into his  vassals’ hearts and of knowing their thoughts without question asked  and answer given; even without any uttered word. A man who cannot  divine the unspoken thoughts of his dependents will not long retain  the prestige vital for a Gothi, or for any sort of chieftainship.  Necessarily, I know much without being told, with hardly even a glance.  Mostly for instance, I can foresee months in advance, sometimes even  years in advance, what girl each youth will woo for his wife, what  maiden each lad desires, even what lad finds favor in each maiden’s  eyes. Such must any chieftain divine.”    At Hofstadir Thorkell was soon at home among the buildings. Not less  than by the chimney, inset fireplace and lavish wood fire was he  impressed by the fortifications of the homestead. It was protected all  round with a dry moat, the earth from which, thrown up on the inner  side, formed a considerable rampart, topped on all four sides of the  enclosure by a solid wall of large, roughly squared blocks of stone.  At the corners were jutting, bulging circular bastions well stockaded  with birch logs, set deep in the earth, butt up and touching each  other, everyone fully three spans broad at the upturned butt, for, in  those early days, the primeval woods of Iceland furnished logs much  larger than any now obtainable on the island. The stockades, like the  walls, were breast-high. Thorkell had never seen a bastion before, nor  heard of one, and was much impressed by the novelty, originality and  manifest adequacy of the device. The idea of a bastion, that it affords  defenders of a fortification an opportunity of shooting sideways at an  assailant crossing the fosse or scaling the parapet, appears so obvious  to us that we can scarcely realize that there ever was a time when  it was unknown. Yet, hundreds, even thousands of years after it was  common and a matter of course in the Mediterranean countries, it had  not yet penetrated the ruder northern lands. In fact, in all parts of  the world, men were not quick to conceive the idea, and, as with other  devices, very slow to adopt it from foemen.    Almost as much was Thorkell impressed by the bath-house, a small  structure, one might say a hut, built of sod and stone, with a low  door and only one very tiny window. Inside there was room for only one  person and a pail of water beside a very small stone stove. This was  heated almost red-hot and then the bather, with a dipper, poured on  it water which at once filled the hut with steam, both cleansing and  refreshing.    On either side of the chimney-piece in the great hall was a sort of  trophy of spears, shields and swords arranged in a pattern like a  six-pointed star; six short pikes crossed and lashed to pegs, six small  round shields set between the radiating spears, and twelve swords, two  by each shield. Above the fireplace was another, of six long swords,  their points together, their hilts apart, with shields between.    Thorkell, inquiring about these, was told that they had been placed  there by Thorstein’s grandfather, Thorleif Vilgerdson, who had built  the hall and temple. The spears and swords forming the two flanking  trophies were fine and valued weapons of former Vilgerdsons: the trophy  over the fireplace was formed of the very sword worn all his life by  Floki Vilgerdson the Viking and settler, and of five cunningly exact  replicas of it, made at Thorleif Vilgerdson’s command by Hoskuld  Vestarson, a famous smith.    “I do not myself know,” said Thorstein, “which is Floki’s blade. My  father told me that he did not know. No one knows. No man has used  any one of those six swords since before I was born. It is told that  Floki’s blade is enchanted, that no one except a Vilgerdson could  wield it, that to anyone not a Vilgerdson it would be heavier than  a thick bar of iron; but that, in time of peril to Floki’s heirs  or kin, it is magical to infuse into its wielder superhuman valor,  swiftness, dexterity and strength. It is also told of Floki’s blade  that it knows friend from foe and will not smite a friend, no matter  how frenziedly its wielder believes him a foe, nor yet will it fail to  smite a treacherous foe, no matter how implicitly its wielder trusts  the traitor. We have come to regard these swords as almost as holy as  the bolts in the pillars by the High Seat in our temple, as almost as  sacred as the temple ring itself. Their presence in our hall we regard  as a protection and safeguard to us all, as a sort of talisman for  Hofstadir. We all and all my men-at-arms and thingmen and retainers  reverence and treasure them.”    Thorkell could see that they were very handsome swords.    He learned that Thorstein never had fewer than sixty men-at-arms on  duty, but not all of them were ever at Hofstadir itself. Some were on  watch along the cliffs, on the lookout for an attack from seaward.  There were always two or more patrol-boats on the offing conning the  sea northwards. The lookouts on the cliffs also watched the fiord for  signs of an attempt to attack in boats from its northern shore. And  some men-at-arms were always scattered about at the farmsteads of  Thorstein’s thingmen and other dependents, especially towards the head  of Revdarfiord, round which must come any attack in force by land.    Thorkatla he found kind-hearted, but taciturn, sharp-tongued when  she did speak, and of a very stern, harsh and austere disposition.  Thorgerd, staid, astute and shrewd, was yet, by nature, trustful,  unsuspicious, confiding, artless and unaffected. She gave Thorkell an  experience entirely novel to him. For she displayed for him a warm  sisterly interest, as to which she was entirely frank and open, while  indubitably ardently in love with her handsome Finnvard.    Thorarna and Thordis he greatly admired and liked. He could not make  out at first which he liked better. That both were manifestly deeply  in love with him he took as a matter of course. He had long become  habituated to having attractive maidens fall in love with him on short  acquaintance and show it.    The immemorial usages of Scandinavian life made it absolutely  unthinkable, in the Iceland of those days, that a young man and a young  woman should ever be alone together, even for a moment. But, on the  other hand, life in Iceland was so free, open, frank, spontaneous,  unconventional and inartificial that not only were lads and lasses  constantly encountering each other about the dwellings, but that not  merely was chatting a matter of course and unremarked, but that such  young folk as Thorkell, Thorarna and Thordis might and did walk about  together out of doors, and sit together side by side conversing for  hours in the hall, in full sight of those about them, unnoticed and  left to themselves.    In this way Thorkell became rapidly well-acquainted with both his  host’s nieces and heard from each her story; stories very much alike  and of a kind far too common in Iceland at that period, and for  centuries later. The envenomed and unremitting enmity between the  Revdarfirthers and their neighbors the Miofifirthers and Seydisfirthers  had resulted in recurrent reprisals.    Thorarna was the only survivor of an overwhelmingly successful assault  upon her father’s homestead. Her father, Thorstein’s brother Thorleik,  had been killed in the fighting, and, when the buildings were set on  fire by the victorious assailants, all the family had perished in the  flames except Thorarna, who, a child of three, had been saved by her  faithful nurse.    Thordis, the only daughter of Thorstein’s brother Thorgest, was the  survivor of a similar massacre.    Much of the evening leisure at Hofstadir was taken up with tales of  such atrocities as these and of like assaults on homesteads, some by  one side, some by the other; some craftily planned, artfully delivered  and overwhelmingly successful; others resulting in drawn battles and  leaving the homestead in mourning for some of its defenders, but  unpillaged and unburnt; yet others unplanned, impulsive, foolhardy,  undermanned or bungled in delivery and resulting in the utter  discomfiture of the assailants. Thorkell sat in silence and listened  to many long tales of this kind from Olmod the house-skald, from  Thorstein himself and from his elder sons. From them also he listened  to even longer tales of complaints against one or the other side before  the Althing at Thingvellir, nearly every year at the two-weeks summer  meeting of this national assembly. They told in great detail of the  impassioned accusations of the plaintiffs, of the indignant rejoinders  of the defendants, of the citations of the respondents before the  high court of justice, of the evidence of the witnesses for each side,  of the arguments of the lawmen, of the disagreements of the judges,  of their occasional agreement, of their verdicts and judgments and of  the indemnities they assessed upon the convicted aggressors. In almost  every case Thorkell heard of the ignoring or flouting of the court’s  decision and of yet further reprisals, duels, forays and outrages.  What astonished him most was that, in all these tales of duels,  murders, treacheries, ambushes, pillagings, outrages, butcheries,  massacres and arson and of their consequences, the narrators talked  as if the Althing were an efficient legislature with power to see to  it that its enactments be observed as the law of the island; as if  the courts had the authority they assumed to have and could enforce  their judgments, verdicts, decrees and penalties; as if, in truth,  law and justice did exist in Iceland: whereas, in fact, it appeared  from every tale he listened to, from every detail of every narrative,  that their vaunted Althing was merely a turbulent yearly social  gathering, accomplishing nothing except the waste of time in futile  wrangling, making a vain show of counterfeiting a sham legislature,  which empty pretense all Icelanders kept up with a curious mingling of  unconscious self-deception and shamefaced effrontery; that the courts,  while generally spoken of with respect, were in fact derided by all  malefactors, and unable to give effect to their decrees, judgments  and verdicts, to enforce their penalties or to exact the indemnities  they granted, so that they were, on the whole, a costly, time-wasting,  exhausting and pitiable farce.    It was plain to Thorkell that the Icelanders, if his host and his  household were fair samples, had somehow duped themselves into fancying  that they had courts which dispensed justice and a government which  maintained law and order; whereas it was manifest that they lived in  a condition of utter anarchy, where there was no protection for life  or property except the fighting prowess of the men of a homestead as  concerned themselves, their folk and their possessions; or of the  men-at-arms of a chieftain for him and his. It was plain that beautiful  Thordis, magnificent Thorarna, lovely Thorgerd, fair Arnora, dainty  Valdis and stern Thorkatla were living in daily peril of a horrible  death and were safe only in so far as their men could protect them. Yet  they, like their men, boasted of the noble freedom of life in Iceland,  pitied the servile condition of Norwegians under their tyrannical king,  vaunted their island institutions, and lauded the system of local  gothorths, yearly elections, yearly assemblies at Thingvellir of their  unwieldy and ineffective Althing, and the complex, lengthy, laborious  and fruitless procedure of their fatuous courts. Local pride seemed  a passion which blinded them to the most glaring imperfections of  anything Icelandic.                                        IV      But it mattered very little what was the subject or the nature of the  conversation, Thorkell found himself more than contented with any  length of time which he might spend with either Thorarna or Thordis.  Yet, after not many days, he was aware of a difference in his feelings  for the two and of theirs for him. Thordis never avoided him, but  never put herself in his way. If everything was favorable and they  happened to be thrown together accidentally, she frankly enjoyed being  with him, but never did anything to prolong a chat or to bring one  about. Thorarna, on the contrary, was most ingenious in postponing the  termination of a colloquy, and was most fertile in clever, adroit, and  unobtrusive devices which resulted in their being together.    Before many days life at Hofstadir, for Thorkell, consisted chiefly  of endeavoring to be with Thordis. Once, when he was basking in her  smiles, her face suddenly clouded and she said:    “There! Thorarna has gone! Please, please try to spend more of your  time with her and less with me. From childhood she and I have been  happy together, and nothing has ever blurred our love for each other  and our unreserved mutual confidence until she began to grow jealous  of me. Since she fell in love with you we have become alienated; she  is chilly to me, distant, reticent, even unfriendly. I grieve that we  are estranged. I love her and I want her to love me. I do not want  her to hate me. Please do all you can to placate her. She keeps her  countenance and is always outwardly serene, sedate and stately. But she  rages inwardly and is so infuriated when you talk to me that I dread  her. Please avoid me and propitiate her all you can. Please promise me  that you will do as I ask.”    Thorkell promised, and, for some days, barely greeted Thordis and  had no converse with her whatever, whereas he spent long hours with  Thorarna, and, to his amazement, found that he enjoyed her society  keenly; yet, even more to his amazement, felt that, when he was not  with Thorarna, he longed for Thordis so acutely that he could hardly  restrain himself from seeking her out and telling her how much he loved  her.    The long spell of clear, mild weather merged into weather decidedly  warm, weather which would have been warm even for Scotland or England.  Thorstein, with a large retinue of spearmen, rode out to visit and  inspect the outlying fringe of farms tenanted by his dependents or  thingmen. It was a very fair day and they had expected an easy jaunt  and an early return to Hofstadir. So it turned out for Thorstein and  most of his company. But, early in the day, they heard a report, hardly  more than a rumor, of distress at a farmstead isolated among uplands  at the extreme southwestern point of Thorstein’s gothorth, very much  out of their way. Thorbrand offered to ride there and investigate  and Thorkell volunteered to go with him. He demurred to his father’s  suggestion that he take some of the men-at-arms, declaring that he and  Thorkell could make better time alone. Off they set. Their errand was  easily accomplished and the rumor found untrue and everyone safe and  well at Mossfell. But, on their return, they encountered conditions  peculiar to Iceland. There it frequently happens during a prolonged  spell of warm weather that great quantities of snow are melted high up  on the plateaus or in hollows among the upper foot-hills, and, very  occasionally, that the waters are dammed back by ice accumulated in  some valley, ravine, gorge or glen, and, if the hot weather lasts on,  are suddenly released by the crumbling of the ice-dam. Such a sudden  and terrific freshet roared across their homeward way and presented a  torrent of deep water not only unfordable, but impossible to swim. They  were, perforce, compelled to await the ebbing of the transitory flood  and so did not reach Hofstadir until the gradual twilight, insensible  gloaming and lingering dusk had melted into semi-darkness.    Thorbrand, sedulously careful of their weary mounts, bade Thorkell go  at once into the hall. Between the stable and the mansion, out of sight  of either behind the storehouse, he encountered Thordis.    She burst into tears; crying:    “Oh! My Love! My Love! Ref and Karli rode in after sunset on lathered  horses reporting that you and Thorbrand had been ambushed and killed.  Oh! My Love! My Love!”    Thorkell caught her in his arms and they clung together, she sobbing,  her head on his breast, he with one arm about her, his other hand  stroking her hair, whispering:    “My Darling! My Darling!”    Suddenly her arms relaxed, she pulled away from him, pushed him from  her, and cried, in a strangled whisper:    “Let me go! Thorarna might see us! Be careful! Thorarna must not see us  together! Let me go! Avoid me! Keep away from me, hardly speak to me!  She must not see us together! Let me go!”    And she sprang away and vanished like a frightened hare.    The weather, for two days afterwards, was not merely warm, but hot,  weather which would have been hot anywhere; an occurrence very unusual  for Iceland, but not unknown, especially on the east coast. On account  of the heat the fire in the hall was allowed to go out entirely, and,  at the evening meal, two of the benches of the men-at-arms were set  across the fireplace, close against the stone work of the chimney-piece.    During these two days Thorkell spent as much time with Thorarna as he  could arrange, and found her fascinating, but moody, high-strung and  capricious. He sedulously avoided Thordis. Only for one moment did they  have an opportunity to exchange a few words. Then Thordis, on the verge  of tears and gasping, said:    “Oh! I am so afraid of Thorarna. I don’t know what I dread, but I am in  the most fearful dread of her. She is very suspicious of you. I think  she conjectures that you and I love each other. You are too distant  with her for her peace of mind. Thorarna, like all her mother’s family,  is petulant, choleric, touchy, irascible, hot-tempered, acrimonious,  vindictive, impulsive, precipitate and hot-headed. Oh, I am so afraid  of her!”    Thorkell tried to calm her, but could not.    Early the third morning, just after dawn had brightened into day, the  lookouts gave the alarm.    And too late!    For, when the garrison of Hofstadir had barely armed and were not  yet all at their posts, there fell upon them three simultaneous and  perfectly coordinated assaults; from the west along the strand, from  the south down the slope, and from the north, from across the fiord by  a party which had made an unopposed landing on the shore.    Thorkell was among the defenders of the western side of the enclosure,  and, despite the hard fight he and his companions put up, their  assailants succeeded in crossing the trench and scaling the wall. But  thereupon they were beaten back by a desperate rally of the denizens,  in which Thorkell played more than his part, for he, single-handed,  successively slew five formidable antagonists. As their foemen wavered  he sprang at a sixth, parried his thrust and got home a deadly stroke  on his helmet.    The sword snapped!    As his adversary was half stunned and wholly dazed by the force of the  blow Thorkell whirled about and made a dash for the hall. There he  leapt upon one of the benches set across the fireplace, seized the hilt  of one of the six identical swords, wrenched it from its fastenings,  and, waving it, dashed out.    As he cleared the doorway he heard elated shouts and an exultant cheer.  Glancing to his right he saw men in chain-mail hauberks vaulting the  eastern wall of the enclosure. He recognized, in the lead, Lodbrok  and Halfdan, the chiefs, Gellir, Sigurd and Bodvar, his treacherous  friends, and others from the crew of the Sea-Raven. He instantly  divined that they had blundered into Miofifiord or Seydisfiord, had  fraternized with the Seydisfirthers and Miofifirthers and had readily  agreed, for their share in the prospective loot, to take part in  capturing and sacking the richest homestead in eastern Iceland.    On fire with his chance of revenge he flew at Lodbrok, and, as he  charged, it seemed to him that never had he run so swiftly, never  had he felt so strong, so capable, so eager for a fray, so sure of  success. He beat back Lodbrok’s guard and swung a full-arm sweep of  his blade at his head. The sword went up like a feather and came down  like a battle-axe. As if through cheese it clove helm, skull, jaw and  chin down into the breast-bone. Lodbrok fell like a pole-axed ox, and,  as Thorkell saw him go down, almost in two halves, he realized that he  was wielding Floki’s blade.    He whirled on Gellir and the sweep of the sword cut clean through  not only both forearms between wrist and elbow, but also through the  stout ash shaft of the pike he wielded. Behind Gellir was Halfdan,  no mean adversary, truculent, wary and skilled. He held his bright,  round, arabesqued shield close against his left shoulder and lunged  cunningly and viciously. Barely parrying his thrust Thorkell swung his  great sword, and, lo! it shore clean through shield, gorget, hauberk,  shoulder and arm, so that his left forequarter fell clear of Halfdan  and he was dead before he crumpled on the earth.    Similarly Thorkell slew Bodvar, Sigurd and Hrodmar. Two the sharp sword  beheaded at a single sweep; one it cleft under the sword-arm, through  his ribs, into his liver; of the fourth its point pierced his heart  through shield and hauberk.    Instinct made Thorkell spin round and he faced Kollgrim Erlendson,  leader of the Vikings and most redoubtable of them all. Their swords  clashed and Kollgrim’s failed, snapped before the hilt, so that  Thorkell’s blade shore off his right shoulder, slicing through the  rings of his chain-mail hauberk as if it had been of hemp, and he died  as his fellow chieftain Halfdan Ingolfson had died.    Although their chiefs were all dead the Vikings, descrying but one  defender before them, were swarming over the wall. Among them Thorkell  dashed and at each stroke of Floki’s blade a foeman died. Yet Thorkell  must have been overwhelmed by mere numbers if some of the Vilgerdsons  and their men-at-arms, now victorious to north and south, had not  flocked to his aid, amazed to see that Hofstadir had been saved by his  unaided valor and spurred on by admiration of him.    Thorkell at their head they drove the survivors of the Sea-Raven’s crew  in headlong flight across the wall and trench, and Thorkell beheld in  the distance the thralls Erp, Ulf, Hundi, Kepp, Sokholf and Vifill,  standing ready with spare shields, spears, bows and quivers, cast away  their burdens and turn in flight before the foremost of the fleeing  Vikings reached them.    The fight was over. The assailants were everywhere beaten and routed.  Thorstein forbade pursuit on foot, and only some twenty of the  men-at-arms found horses ready, mounted and sped out of the main  gateway of the enclosure to complete the rout of the assailants, who  left more than forty corpses behind them.    Of the victors twelve spearmen had fallen and with them seven of  Thorstein’s dependent yeomen, four of his thingmen, and two cousins,  Thorberg Vilgerdson of Snowfell and Thorod Vilgerdson of Gelsbank.  Thorkell, Thorstein himself and Thorfinn were the only unwounded  warriors among the defenders. All the rest of the family, all the  cousins, thingmen, yeomen, and men-at-arms had suffered one or more  wounds; but, of the family, only Thord was wounded seriously. His  wounds were at once bound up and the blood staunched.    Then, with one accord, every warrior of them all acclaimed Thorkell  as their savior. They cheered him and saluted him as “hero.” Thorfinn  and Thorgeir seized him by the elbows, and, following their father and  followed by the cheering throng, marched him into the great hall and up  to the High Seat. There Thorstein stood aside and motioned Thorkell to  mount the dais and occupy the High Seat. Before his dazed astonishment  could protest, Thorfinn and Thorgeir had gently forced him into it.  There he sat, Floki’s blade, still red, point down between his knees,  his hands crossed on the pommel of the upright hilt.    Thorstein shouted:    “Mead for the hero! Not a man of us shall touch horn or bowl to lip  until the hero has had his fill of my best mead. Mead for the hero!”    At the call Thorarna appeared from the kitchen through the rear  doorway carrying with both hands a great bowl high before her. Down  the hall she came, her face lit with a triumphant smile, magnificent  and stately. Before the High Seat she knelt and offered the bowl to  Thorkell. The fighters cheered again.    As Thorarna held up the bowl, Thorkell, to his horror, felt his right  hand grasp the sword-hilt with a grip he could not loosen, felt  the sword raise itself and his arm till the blade swung high above  Thorarna, felt the magic of the sword drag down his arm in a deadly  sweep, felt and saw the blow descend, felt and saw the blade shear  through Thorarna’s left shoulder, shoulder-blade, collar-bone and  ribs, cleaving her to the very heart.    She crumpled in a horrid welter of spilt mead, gushing blood,  disordered raiment and huddled flesh.    The onlookers stood, frozen mute.    Into the hall rushed Thordis and Thorgerd, screaming:    “Do not drink! The mead is poisoned! Do not drink! The mead is  poisoned!”    At sight of the High Seat, Thorkell on it and what lay before him,  Thordis collapsed in a faint. Thorgerd was at once absorbed in tending  her cousin.    Thorstein shouted for his thralls.    “Ref! Karli! Mar! Odd! Remove that carrion! Cleanse the dais!”    And, when his orders had been obeyed and the dais and hall were again  seemly, he called once more:    “Mead for the hero!”    Thordis, now restored, though tottering, her golden-haired,  pink-cheeked, blue-eyed loveliness amazing even in her confusion,  herself carried to Thorkell a horn.    He took it, quaffed it as he sat and handed it back to her. Then  Thorstein shouted:    “Mead for all of us, and more mead for the hero!”    Maid servants flocked in with bowls, horns and goblets and behind them  thralls with pails of mead to replenish those drained. All drank,  Thorkell too, a second horn offered him by Thordis. From her knees he  raised her and made her stand beside the High Seat.    Then Thorstein shouted:    “Hail the hero!”    Whereupon all the warriors cheered Thorkell until they were hoarse.    Into the ensuing silence Thorstein spoke clearly and gravely:    “To-morrow we shall revel in honor of our deliverance, victory and  safety. And the banquet shall be the wedding feast of my niece Thordis  and of her bridegroom, my cousin, Thorkell Vilgerdson of Rogaland in  Norway, our hero!”
